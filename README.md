## Developing

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Now you can edit whatever you want. üòÅ
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Deploy

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

App is ready to be deployed!
